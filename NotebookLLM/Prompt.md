Explain the entire chapter in a clear, structured manner suitable for analog IC design study.
For each major section and amplifier topology in Chapter 3:
What the concept is
Explain the purpose of the circuit
Describe how it works intuitively and physically
Identify where and why it is used in analog CMOS design
Challenges and limitations
Gain, bandwidth, and output swing limitations
Noise, linearity, and distortion issues
Headroom constraints (especially in low-voltage designs)
Sensitivity to process, temperature, and supply variations
Practical techniques to mitigate these issues
Circuit-level solutions (cascode, source degeneration, active loads, biasing choices)
Device sizing strategies
Bias current and operating-region selection
Layout and matching considerations where relevant
Use equations where necessary, but focus on physical intuition and design insight rather than pure math.
